What is Angular?
	Angular is a framework used for application development with number of features.

Why Angular?
1) One framework for different platforms [Web/Desktop/Mobile Web/Mobile]
2) PWA - Progressive Web Application Development [Online/Offline]
3) Angular is modular framework
4) You can also develop you application in modular way
5) It will help load application functionalities in a eager or lazy way
6) You can develop Angular application as SPA - Single Page Application
7) Angular provides routing library @angular/router
8) Provides rich animation @angular/animations 
9) Angular supports multiple languages for development
	[Typescript/Dart/JavaScript]
10) Angular offers component based development [In-built components]
11) Angular offers number of directives [out-of-the-box] and you can also develop your own directives
12) Angular offers rich data binding support
	[One-Way [Source-To-Destination/Destination-To-Source]/Two-Way]
13) Change Detection Cycle [CDC]
14) Zone.js [Polyfill]
15) Zoneless Change Detection [Released Development Preview for zoneless]
16) Data Formatting - using Angular Pipe [In-built/Custom/Third-party]
17) Angular offers service based implementation [Clear separation between logic and view/display + reusability of data and logic]
18) In-built container with dependency injection functionality
19) Angular comes with built-in number of services which we can use via D.I.
20) Angular provides library for HTTP calls [AJAX] @angular/common/http
21) Angular has official components library and CDK - [Component Development Kit] along with themes
	Angular Material - @angular/materials
22) Angular application development - 
	I) Project/Application
	II) Library - Share the components/services/pipes across multiple angular application in your organization/public
23) Angular Element Development - Can be used in non-angular applications. For Ex. React/Vue/Html/...
24) Angular Standalone development [Component/Directive/Pipe] 
	Without NgModule
25) Angular rich Forms - 
	I) Template Driven Forms
	II) Reactive Forms
26) Angular team offered a CLI - [Command Line Interface] @angular/cli to create Angular applications - 
	Comes with default project structure with 3-environments [Development/Testing/Production]
27) Default testing framework integration with Angular is -
	Jasmine 
29) Test Runner Karma
30) Offered Control Follow Statements [Earlier we used directives for the same]
	Earlier - *ngFor/*ngIf/*ngSwitch
	Today - @if { }/@if-else { }/@switch { }/@for { }
31) Signals [Stable in 20+]
32) RxJS - Reactive Extensions for JavaScript [Library]
	Observable/Observer pattern with number of operators. Developers use this instead of Promise Object of ECMAScript
33) Compilation - 
	JIT Compilation [Just-In-Time Compilation]
	AoT Compilation [Ahead-Of-Time Compilation]
34) Angular uses Ivy rendering engine [One of the fastest rendering engines]
35) Angular offers speed and performance
36) Angular offers SSR [Server Side Rendering]
37) Angular provides support for internationalization using [i18n library]

CSR - Client Side Rendering [is not optimized for search]

Creating First Angular application - 

1) Install Angular CLI tool globally on your machine using package manager [NPM]
	npm install -g @angular/cli [Install it once/when you want update]

2) Create new Angular application using Angular CLI
	ng new first-bosch-ng-app
3) Change the directory and navigate to ng app folder
	ng serve


angular.json contains configuration of Angular application for different environments [dev/test/prod]

How does Angular application run? [Angular Application's Bootstrapping Process]

1) When you create angular application using CLI tool, it will always contain one component which gets rendered in your browser via index.html


Component [.ts(logic)/.html(display)/.css(styling)/.spec.ts(Unit test cases)]

Angular Coding Style Guide - 


https://angular.dev/style-guide

Configure Bootstrap CSS Framework in Angular application?


Configure JavaScript bundle from the official bootstrap bundle
	npm install bootstrap

For themes, you can use third-party bootstrap CSS file
	npm install bootswatch


Angular CLI generate command - 
	1) Check which generate commands are possible using ng tool
		ng g --help

Components Generation

	ng g c movies/movies-list
	ng g c movies/movie-details

Models Generation
	ng g cl movies/movie-model

Service Generation
	ng g s movies/movie-api

Pipe Generations
	ng g p movies/filter-by-pipe

Directive
	ng g d movies/snowfall

movies
	movies-list [component]

	movie-details [component]

	movie-model.ts [model]

	movie-api.ts [service]
	
	date-pipe.ts
	

Proof-Of-Concept - 

Bosch Events Portal - [Roles - Employee, Hr]

	Employee Role - 
		1) Employee will register in our portal
		2) Employee can see other employees list and their details
		3) Employee can see list of events and see the details of the events
		4) Register for an event
		5) They can give feedback to attended events
	Hr Role - 
		Everything an employee can do, Hr can also do the same thing
		6) Hr can create/postpone/cancel events
		7) Hr can take feedback
		8) Hr can generate reports


Day-1
	1) Create new Angular application -
		bosch-events-portal
	2) Configure CSS Bootstrap framework with third-party theme [Bootswatch] in our portal
	3) Run and test the application by adding static HTML contents in root component


Introduction to Components - 

1) Component is a part of webpage
2) Component extends the vocabulary of Html elements
3) Component has its own appearance and behaviour 
4) Component also maintain its own state within itself 

You can add component files - 
	1) app.ts [Logic/Maintain the state] [Component Class]
	2) app.html [Display] [Component Template]
		Template Types - 
			1) Inline Template
				i) Single Line
				ii) Multi-line
			2) Linked/External Template
				.html page
	3) app.css [Styling]
	4) app.spec.ts [Testing]

Building Blocks - 

1) Component
2) Service [Sharing data and logic]
3) Pipe [Data Formatting]
4) Directive [Changing the behaviour of any element]

All major building blocks are classes in Angular

Angular offers number of metadata which you use using decorator pattern [@]. Metadata tells angular framework how to process a class

All metadata comes from core library of Angular - @angular/core


@Component({
	selector : 'app-root',
	templateUrl : './app.html',
	imports : [dependencies - In-built dependencies of Angular framework/Custom Dependencies]
})
export class App {

}

@Injectable({...}) [Service]
export class UserAuthentication {

}
@Pipe({...}) [Pipe]
export class DateGlobalization {

}
@Directive({...}) [Directive]
export class Highlighter {

}


Data Formatting - Pipes [In-built/Third-party/Custom Pipes]

Using pipes - 
	property | pipe
	property | pipe:arg1:arg2



How does pipe work internally?

import { Pipe, PipeTransform } from "@angular/core";

@Pipe({
	name:'myCustomPipe'
})
export class PipeName implements PipeTransform{
	transform(value : unknown, ...args:unknown[]):unknown{
		//write logic for the data formatting
	}
}

property | myCustomPipe:'one':'two'

startDate | multiLingualDate:'hi-IN'

---------------------------

Day-2 Assignments - 

	1) Add EmployeesList and EmployeeDetails components in employees feature folder
	2) Add filter to filter employees by their name [Filter - Starts with]
	3) Display Employee Details component in Modal box
	4) Add sorting on EventsList and EmployeesList tables [On all columns]
	5) Correct the working of search after changing the page number in both [EventsList and EmployeesList]
